# point_in_polygon
Draws by checking if point is inside. This requires a "point in polygon" testing.

## documented elsewhere ( ??? )
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon>
  - mentions :
    - Ray casting algorithm .
    - Winding number algorithm .
  - doesn't mention :
    - Concavity-removal algorithm ( this how I named this not sure if it's already discovered and baptized , named somehow ) .
